# Deep Learning Approaches Comparison on the Diabetes Dataset

This project compares two different deep learning approaches using the Diabetes dataset:

1. Using Keras & TensorFlow with a high-level API
2. Without any deep learning frameworks (built from scratch using Python & NumPy)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To observe the differences between high-level frameworks and manual development in terms of **speed, optimization, and flexibility**, as well as the learning depth gained from implementing neural networks from scratch.


## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

### Without Frameworks (From Scratch)
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for preprocessing and metrics)

### Keras & TensorFlow Model
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
